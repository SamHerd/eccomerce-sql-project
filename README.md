# Click Behavior Analysis & Purchase Trends  

## Project Overview  
This project was designed to **refine my SQL skills** and analyze **customer click behavior and purchase trends** using SQL and Power BI.  

I used **SQL scripts** to extract, transform, and analyze e-commerce data, focusing on **session activity, cart actions, and customer segmentation**.  
The **Power BI dashboard** provides **visual insights** into customer interactions, cart abandonment, and key performance metrics.

## ðŸ› **SQL Scripts Overview**
This project includes **several SQL scripts** that handle:  

**Data Extraction & Cleaning**  
- Importing and organizing raw data from multiple tables (**customers, sessions, transactions, cart actions, page views, and products**).  
- Standardizing customer IDs, timestamps, and action types for consistency.  

**Customer Behavior Analysis**  
- Identifying high-value vs. occasional customers based on purchase history.  
- Tracking **add-to-cart** vs. **actual purchases** to analyze conversion rates.  
- Measuring **cart abandonment rates** and session activity.  

**Session & Click Tracking**  
- Analyzing device usage patterns (mobile vs. desktop).  
- Tracking geographic trends in **click behavior** and **purchase likelihood**.  
- Filtering sessions with high engagement but no purchases.  

**Final Queries for Power BI Integration**  
- Aggregating **total sessions, clicks, cart actions, and purchases**.  
- Preparing **customer segmentation metrics** for Power BI visualization.

## **Power BI Dashboard Overview**
The **Power BI dashboard** transforms SQL query results into **interactive visual insights**, including:  

 **Funnel Chart:** Tracks customer journey from **clicks â†’ add to cart â†’ purchase**.  
 **Cart Abandonment Rate:** Highlights where customers drop off before purchasing.  
 **Customer Segmentation:** Analyzes **high-value vs. occasional buyers**.  
 **Device & Location Analysis:** Compares conversion rates across **mobile, desktop, and regions**.  

**Goal:** Use data-driven insights to improve conversion rates and refine marketing strategies.
